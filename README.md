# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse
A gesture-controlled virtual mouse is a system that allows users to control their computer cursor using hand gestures instead of a physical mouse. The technology behind this system involves using a camera or sensor to track the movement of the user's hand, and translating those movements into corresponding actions on the computer screen.

The user typically wears a small sensor device on their hand or wrist that detects and tracks the movement of their hand. The sensor communicates with the computer software, which then interprets the movement of the hand and translates it into cursor movement on the screen.

Users can perform a variety of gestures to control the cursor, including moving their hand in different directions, making a clicking motion with their fingers, and even performing more complex gestures for specific actions like scrolling or zooming.

Gesture-controlled virtual mice can be particularly useful in situations where physical mice may be difficult to use, such as when working in tight spaces, or for individuals with physical disabilities that make it difficult to use traditional computer input devices.

Overall, this technology offers a new and innovative way to interact with computers and provides an alternative to traditional input devices like mice and keyboards.
